    "\n",
    "• Which model performed best and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Model = Random Forest Tuned\n",
    "Reason: Strong generalization ability, ensemble approach, robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Which features were most important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Features with higher importance values contribute more to the model's decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are predicting Placement, and CGPA has high importance → they influence predictions the most.\n",
    "Features with very low importance could be considered for removal (feature selection)\n",
    "\n",
    "• How did hyperparameter tuning improve results?\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ So: Hyperparameter tuning improved stability, robustness, and generalization—even if accuracy looks the same."

    "Mean CGPA: 7.53 – Most students have good academic scores.\n",

    "Median: 7.53 – Close to the mean, so the data is nearly symmetric.\n",

    "\n",
    "Default KNN performed moderately, but tuning k (neighbors) improved accuracy and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still weaker than Random Forest and Decision Tree, especially in handling complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Works well for smaller datasets but is slower for large datasets due to distance calculations.\n",
